# TrainTrips-Hunt
TrainTrip Hunt analyzes train schedules and predicts the likelihood of delays using RTC data, weather reports, and other crucial factors. This allows users to strategically book tickets for trains most likely to be delayed, enabling them to claim refunds under UK delay compensation schemesâ€”effectively making travel cheaper and smarter.
